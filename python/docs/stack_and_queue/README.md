# Stacks and Queues
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue(this is from the features instructions of lab)


## Challenge
The challenge is to create a stack and queue module. Value is pushed into the stack and value is popped from the very top of stack, checking if the value at top is empty.
For Queue, A value is put within the enqueue, that removes a value from the front of dequeue checking if front queue is empty.


## Approach & Efficiency

create variables for the class Stack and queue that add a node or removes nodes, that will return a true or false value
